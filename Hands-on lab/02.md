## Exercise 2: Migrate SQL Server to Azure SQL Database using DMS

Duration: 60 minutes

World Wide Importers would like a Proof of Concept (POC) that moves their data warehouse to Azure SQL Database. They would like to know about any incompatible features that might block their eventual production move. In this exercise, you will use the [Azure Database Migration Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/database-migration/) (DMS) to perform an assessment on their SQL Server 2008 R2 data warehouse database, and then migrate the WorldWideImporters database from the "on-premises" SQL Server 2008 R2 instance to [Azure SQL Database](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/).

### Task 1: Assess the on-premises database

World Wide Importers would like an assessment to see what potential issues they would have to address in moving their database to Azure SQL Database.

1. On the SqlServer2008 VM, download the [Data Migration Assistant v5.x](https://www.microsoft.com/download/confirmation.aspx?id=53595) and run the downloaded installer.

2. Select **Next** on each of the screens, accepting to the license terms and privacy policy in the process.

3. Select **Install** on the Privacy Policy screen to begin the installation.

4. On the final screen, check the **Launch Microsoft Data Migration Assistant** check box, and select **Finish**.

   ![Launch Microsoft Data Migration Assistant is selected and highlighted at the bottom of the Microsoft Data Migration Assistant Setup dialog box.](./media/data-migration-assistant-setup-finish.png "Run the Microsoft Data Migration Assistant")

5. In the Data Migration Assistant window, select the New **(+)** icon in the left-hand menu.

   ![+ New is selected and highlighted in the Data Migration Assistant window.](./media/data-migration-assistant-new-project.png "Select + New")

6. In the New project dialog, enter the following:

   - **Project type**: Select Assessment.
   - **Project name**: Enter Assessment.

   ![Check database compatibility and Check feature parity are selected and highlighted on the Options screen.](./media/data-migration-assistant-options.png "Select the report types")

8. In the **Connect to a server** dialog on the **Select sources** tab, enter `SQLSERVER2008` into the Server name box, and **uncheck Encrypt connection**, then select **Connect**.

   ![In the Connect to a server dialog box, SQLSERVER2008 is highlighted in the Server name box, and Encrypt connection is unchecked and highlighted below that in the Connect to a server dialog box.](./media/data-migration-assistant-select-sources-sqlserver2008.png "Enter information in the Connect to a server dialog box")

9. In the **Add sources** dialog that appears, check the box next to **WideworldImporters**, and select **Add**.

   ![WorldWideImporters is selected and highlighted under SQLSERVER2008 in the Add sources dialog box.](https://github.com/microsoft/MCW-Data-Platform-upgrade-and-migration/blob/master/Hands-on%20lab/media/data-migration-assistant-select-sources-sqlserver2008-wideworldimporters.png "Select WorldWideImporters")

10. Select **Start Assessment**.

11. Review the Assessment results, selecting both **SQL Server feature parity** and **Compatibility issues** options and viewing the reports.

    ![Various information is selected on the Review results screen.](./media/data-migration-assistant-review-results-sqlserver2008-worldwideimporters.png "Review the Assessment results")

12. You now have a list of the issues WWI will need to consider in upgrading their database to Azure SQL Database. Notice the assessment includes recommendations on the potential resolutions to issues. You can select **Export Assessment** on the top toolbar to save the report as a JSON file, if desired.

### Task 2: Migrate the database schema

After you have reviewed the assessment results and you have ensured the database is a candidate for migration to Azure SQL Database, use the Data Migration Assistant to migrate the schema to Azure SQL Database.
