### Task 5: Create the Northwind database in Oracle 11g XE

WWI has provided you with a copy of their application, including a database script to create their Oracle database. They have asked that you use this as a starting point for migrating their database and application to SQL Server 2017. In this task, you will create a connection to the Oracle database on your Lab VM, and create a database called Northwind.

1. On your SqlServer2017 VM, open SQL Server Management Studio 17 (SSMS), select **Connect** in the Object Explorer, and select **Database Engine**.

   ![Database Engine is selected and highlighted under Connect, which is highlighted in Object Explorer.](./media/ssms-connect-database-engine.png "Select Database Engine")

    - `3.northwind.oracle.packages.sql`

    - `4.northwind.oracle.sps.sql`

      - During the Execute script step for this file, you will need to execute each CREATE OR REPLACE statement independently.

      - Using your mouse, select the first statement, starting with CREATE and going to END;

      ![The first statement between CREATE and END is highlighted.](./media/visual-studio-fusion-query-selection.png "Select the first statement")

      - Repeat this for each of the remaining CREATE OR REPLACE... END; blocks in the script file (there are 7 more to execute, for 8 total).

    - `5.northwind.oracle.seed.sql`

      > **Important**: This query can take several minutes to run, so make sure you wait until you see **Execute succeeded** message, followed by **Done: 5.northwind.oracle.seed.sql**, in the output window before executing the next file, like the following:

      ![This is a screenshot of the Execute succeeded message in the output window.](./media/visual-studio-fusion-query-completed.png "Execute succeeded message")

    - `6.northwind.oracle.constraints.sql`

   ![Web.config is selected under the NorthwindMVC project within the Solution 'NorthwindMVC' in Solution Explorer.](./media/visual-studio-solution-explorer-northwindmvc-web-config.png "Open Web.config")

3. In the `Web.config` file, locate the `connectionStrings` section, and verify the connection string named **OracleConnectionString** matches the values you have used in this hands-on lab:

   ```xml
   DATA SOURCE=localhost:1521/XE;PASSWORD=oracledemo123;USER ID=NW
   ```

   ![The information above is highlighted in the Web.config file.](./media/visual-studio-web-config-connection-strings.png "Verify the connection string")

4. Run the solution by selecting the green **Start** button on the Visual Studio toolbar.

   ![Start is selected on the toolbar.](./media/visual-studio-toolbar-start.png "Run the solution")

5. You should see the Northwind Traders Dashboard load in your browser.

   ![The Northwind Traders Dashboard is visible in a browser.](./media/northwind-traders-dashboard.png "View the dashboard")

   > **Note**: If you receive an error about being unable to find part of the path for `bin\roslyn\csc.exe`, stop the debugging session by selecting the Stop button on the toolbar. Next, select Tools -> NuGet Package Manager -> Package Manager Console, and at the prompt execute the following command: `Update-Package Microsoft.CodeDom.Providers.DotNetCompilerPlatform -r`. Once the command finishes, run the solution again.

6. Close the browser to stop debugging the application, and return to Visual Studio.
